### 75. Sort Colors

Given an array with *n* objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:**
You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

#### 解题思路

先进行计数，数出nums中，0， 1， 2各包含有几个，然后根据个数依次对nums进行赋值

#### 参考代码

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        count_0 = 0
        count_1 = 0
        count_2 = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if num == 0:
                count_0 += 1
            if num == 1:
                count_1 += 1
            if num == 2:
                count_2 += 1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            
            if i >= 0 and i < count_0:
                nums[i] = 0
            elif i >= count_0 and i < (count_0 + count_1):
                nums[i] = 1
            else:
                nums[i] = 2
```
